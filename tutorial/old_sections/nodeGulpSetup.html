			<h1>Ok, we're ready to start building our app.</h1>
			<p>Now that some of the basics are out of the way, let's get ourselves into a module-based environment.</p>
			<p>Feel free to put together your build system of choice, or follow these instructions to use my
				gulp/browserify boilerplate:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>If you haven't already, <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank">download and install
					Node.js (includes npm)</a>.</li>
				<li>Once Node.js is installed, download and unzip <a href="./mithril_tutorial_1.zip">the blank <i>mithril_tutorial_1</i> folder</a>.
					It currently contains only the <i>.gulpfile</i> and <i>package.json</i> file you'll need, along with a near-empty <i>src</i> folder.
					You can move the <i>mithril_tutorial_1</i> folder to your preferred working projects location.</li>
				<li>In a terminal window, <code class="language-bash">cd</code> into <i>mithril_tutorial_1</i>, then type
					<pre><code class="language-bash">npm install</code></pre></li>
				<li>After the installation has finished, type
					<pre><code class="language-bash">gulp</code></pre></li>
				<li>Open a new tab in terminal, <code class="language-bash">cd</code> into <i>mithril_tutorial_1/build</i>, then type
					<pre><code class="language-bash">live-server</code></pre>
					You should now have a new, empty window or tab in your default browser.</li>
				<li>The last step is to bring your gulp tab in Terminal to the foreground. Bad errors in CSS or 
					JavaScript can crash the build process, so if that happens, you'll need to 
					<code class="language-bash">gulp</code> again after you've fixed your code.</li>
			</ol>
