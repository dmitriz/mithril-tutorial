			<h1>A Note About Hyperscript Indentation</h1>
			<p>In all templating languages, figuring out a good indentation strategy is no joke. You (and your teammates)
				need to be able to read and comprehend your code as quickly as possible. Mithril's hyperscript is no
				exception.</p>
			<p>Certainly, you'll find your own, preferred style. That said, I find that for any but the simplest structures,
				a multi-line, comma-first approach leads to the most readable code.</p>
			<p>I follow a very simple set of guidelines:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>New line for every new <code class="language-javascript">m()</code>, preceded by its comma</li>
				<li>New line for every attributes object, preceded by its comma</li>
				<li>Normal formatting for functions within attributes objects</li>
				<li>All of these rules can be ignored for very simple structures, where new lines would just make it 
					harder to read, e.g. <code class="language-javascript">m('', {title: 'text title'}, 'Some text')</code></li>
			</ol>
			<p>In this way, the resulting HTML's nesting is an almost perfect mirror of our hyperscript; the only 
				meaningful exceptions being hyperscript's attribute objects.
			</p>
