			<h1>Mithril.js â€” Tutorial 1</h1>
			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p>We're going to take a quick look at the fundamentals of building a single-page application (SPA)
				with Mithril.js, beginning with "Hello World".</p>
			<p>After we've learned a couple of basic concepts, we'll begin building a simple application
				which manages a list of teachers, and a list of courses. We'll be able to edit each course's
				title, and to change its teacher. We'll also be able to edit teachers' first and last names,
				and we'll display a list of the courses each is teaching.</p>
			<p>You can see the full, working application
